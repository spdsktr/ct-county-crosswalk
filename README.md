Relate ZIP Codes, ZIP+4 and Towns to Historical CT Counties

The CT-ZIP-Code-Crosswalk.csv file contains a crosswalk between CT ZIP Codes and their primary historical County. Also included is USPS City names and new Planning Region (county equivalent).

The ZIP4-CT-County-Crosswalk.csv file contains a crosswalk between CT ZIP+4 Records and their primary historical County. Also included is the new Planning Region (county equivalent) for each ZIP+4.

The CT-Town-County-Crosswalk.csv file contains all 169 Connecticut towns as well as their historical County assignment and new Planning Region (county equivalent).

#### Notes
Connecticut's nine planning regions became effective as county-equivalents on July 1, 2024. This is a permanent change. The transition from data sources using counties to the new planning regions has been, and will continue to be, ongoing. The U.S. Census began releasing data at the new region level in 2023. The USPS updated its data products to use planning regions in July 2024. ZIP-Codes.com now provides the Planning Regions for each ZIP Code, but has prepared crosswalk files for those who continue to need the historical county assignment at the ZIP Code and ZIP+4 level.
